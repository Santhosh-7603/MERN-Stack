His major positive role as a scorned lover in S. P. Muthuraman's Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri (1977), 1978's Mullum Malarum and Aval Appadithan received him critical acclaim; the former earned him a Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for Best Actor.[12][13] By the end of the decade, he had worked in all South Indian film industries and established a career in Tamil cinema. He then played dual roles in the action thriller Billa (1980), a remake of the Hindi film Don (1978).

            <p>Rajinikanth had his primary education at the Gavipuram Government Kannada Model Primary School in Bangalore.[37] As a child, he was "studious and mischievous" with a great interest in cricket, football and basketball. During this time, his brother enrolled him at the Ramakrishna Math, a Hindu monastery set up by the Ramakrishna Mission. In the math, he was taught Vedas, tradition and history, which eventually instilled a sense of spirituality in him.[38] In addition to spiritual lessons, he also began acting in plays at the math. His aspiration towards theatre grew at the math and was once given an opportunity to enact the role of Ekalavya's friend from the Hindu epic Mahabharata. His performance in the play received praise from the Kannada poet D. R. Bendre.</p>

            <h3>About Surya: </h3>
            <p>Saravanan Sivakumar (born 23 July 1975[2][3]), known professionally as Suriya, is an Indian actor and film producer who primarily works in Tamil films. One of the highest-paid Tamil actors,[4][5] Suriya is considered as one of the finest actors of Indian cinema.[6][7] Suriya has received numerous accolades including two National Film Awards, six Filmfare Awards South and five Tamil Nadu State Film Awards.[8][9] He has featured six times in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list. After making his debut in Nerukku Ner (1997) at the age of 22, Suriya landed his breakthrough role in Nandhaa (2001) and then had his first major commercial success with the thriller Kaakha Kaakha (2003). Following award-winning performances of a conman in Pithamagan (2003) and a hunchback in Perazhagan (2004), he played a man suffering from anterograde amnesia in the 2005 blockbuster Ghajini.</p>
            <p>Prior to his career in films, Suriya worked at a garment exports factory for eight months.[19] He did not reveal himself to his boss as Sivakumar's son, but his boss ultimately learnt the truth himself.[20] He was initially offered the lead role by Vasanth in his film Aasai (1995), but he rejected the offer citing a lack of interest in an acting career and the offer went to Ajith Kumar.[18] He later debuted in Vasanth's 1997 film Nerrukku Ner, produced by Mani Ratnam when he was 22 years of age.[21] The stage name "Suriya" was bestowed to him by Ratnam to avoid a clash of names with established actor Saravanan. The name "Suriya" was frequently used for characters in Ratnam's films.[22] Vijay, who co-starred with him in the film, would also go on to become a leading contemporary actor in Kollywood.</p>
            <p>This was followed by a series of roles in commercially unsuccessful films in the late 1990s. In 1998, he starred in the romantic film Kaadhale Nimmadhi.[24] In July the same year, he had another release Sandhippoma.[25] Subsequently, he acted with Vijayakanth in the film Periyanna (1999), directed by S. A. Chandrasekhar.[26] That year, he also appeared opposite Jyothika in Poovellam Kettuppar. A critic from The New Indian Express noted, "The-romantic part has little novelty, but Jyothika and Surya perform with bouncy exuberance."[27] His only release in 2000 was Uyirile Kalanthathu, again opposite Jyothika.[28] Suriya confessed that he struggled due to lack of confidence, memory power, fighting or dancing skills in his early career, but it was actor Raghuvaran, one of his mentors, who advised him to create his own identity, rather than stay under his father's shadow.</p>

            <h3>About Karthi: </h3>
            <p>Karthik Sivakumar (born 25 May 1977), credited as Karthi, is an Indian actor who works in Tamil Cinema. He is son of veteran actor Sivakumar who began his career as an assistant director in his elder brother Suriya's film Aayutha Ezhuthu (2004). Latter debuted with Paruthiveeran (2007) and recorded a golden debut in Tamil Cinema with six consecutive success. Karthi is an recipient of three Filmfare Awards South and a Tamil Nadu State Film Award. After a three-year hiatus from acting, he then return to star in films such as Aayirathil Orvuan, Paiyaa and Naan Mahaan Alla, all three of which were released in 2010.</p>
            <p>When Karthi returned to Chennai, he met director Mani Ratnam and got a chance to work as an assistant director in Aayutha Ezhuthu, because he wanted to become a film director and preferred directing to acting,[1] though he did appear as an extra in Aayutha Ezhuthu.[citation needed] He continued to receive acting offers and his father convinced him to take up acting, telling him " ... one can always direct films, but one will not get a chance to act once you grow older".[2] He accepted his first acting assignment with Priyamani as female lead in April 2005.[citation needed] When director Ameer approached him to play the titular character in the film Paruthiveeran, he accepted the offer because the film was " ... so compelling".[1] The filming started in July 2005 and experienced financial difficulties,[citation needed] and was almost abandoned by mid–2006.[citation needed] It was released in January 2007, to critical acclaim and became commercially successful.</p>
            <p>In October 2006, Karthi signed his second project under Selvaraghavan's direction,[8] Idhu Maalai Nerathu Mayakkam, which was supposed to be a romance film,[9] featuring Sandhya as the female lead.[10] Karthi's character was a " ... sophisticated upmarket stylish guy ... ".[11] Selvaraghavan abandoned that project and in July 2007, he announced the production of an action-adventure film titled Aayirathil Oruvan, with Karthi in the lead role.[12] Filming began later that year and was expected to be completed by February 2008. The producers planned to release it in mid-2008,[13] but production was delayed and filming continued until early 2009.[14] He had agreed to play the lead character in Linguswamy's next film Paiyaa, in September 2007.[citation needed] Because of the slow progress of Aayirathil Oruvan, Paiyaa was postponed several times.[15] He later said that he became anxious because he received several film offers, but could not work on them because he needed to maintain the continuity of his looks.[16] During the filming of Aayirathil Oruvan, producer R.Ravindran complained that Karthi was trying to change his look and move on to Paiyaa before finishing his commitments.</p>
