                <p>This film rocked! In just 11 days, it grossed 100 crores. The music was captivating. It was the best action music I have ever heard. A.R. Murugadoss's films are quite nice. Vidyut Jamwal gave us a thrilling feeling as a villain. The music and the action give me goosebumps. Vijay looks handsome, and the fight scenes make sense as to how he can beat up 20 people at once, being a military captain. The topic of sleeper cells and terrorism is amazing. To me, the ending was a little touching. The songs are rocking as well. It's a great piece of cinema!</p>

                    A different theme that tells about the issues of villages and the problems faced due to multinational companies. Vijay's performance and his difference in dual roles are outstanding. Whether he looks like a bubbly Jeeva or a lean, rude, and charming Kathiresan, he excels in both parts. Any idiot can abuse him. But you need to understand that an actor these days, satisfying every part of the audience with song, fight, action, sentiment, and entertainment, is not an easy task. Vijay is always the best actor. I could say this is the best movie for Vijay because it speaks about the burning problems of villagers, especially those involved in agriculture. It brings out the real face of corporate strategies, media, and the lazy approach of urban people towards village problems.

            <h3>About Rajini: </h3>
            <p>Shivaji Rao Gaikwad[a][4] (born 12 December 1950), known professionally as Rajinikanth,[b] is an Indian actor who predominantly works in Tamil cinema.[6] In a career spanning over five decades, he has done 170 films[c] that includes films in Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali, and Malayalam. He is widely regarded to be one of the most successful and popular actors in the history of Indian cinema.[7][8][9] Known for his uniquely styled mannerism and one liners in films, he has a huge fan base and a cult following. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 2000 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2016, India's third and second highest civilian honours respectively, and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2019, the highest Indian award in the field of cinema, for his contributions to Indian cinema.[10][11] He has won numerous film awards including one National Film Award, seven Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, a Nandi Award, one Filmfare Award and two Maharashtra State Film Awards.</p>
            <p>Following his debut in K. Balachander's 1975 Tamil drama Apoorva Raagangal, Rajinikanth's acting career commenced with a brief phase of portraying antagonistic characters in Tamil films. His major positive role as a scorned lover in S. P. Muthuraman's Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri (1977), 1978's Mullum Malarum and Aval Appadithan received him critical acclaim; the former earned him a Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for Best Actor.[12][13] By the end of the decade, he had worked in all South Indian film industries and established a career in Tamil cinema. He then played dual roles in the action thriller Billa (1980), a remake of the Hindi film Don (1978). It was his biggest commercial success to that point, earned him stardom and gave him the action hero image.</p>
            <p>Rajinikanth had his primary education at the Gavipuram Government Kannada Model Primary School in Bangalore.[37] As a child, he was "studious and mischievous" with a great interest in cricket, football and basketball. During this time, his brother enrolled him at the Ramakrishna Math, a Hindu monastery set up by the Ramakrishna Mission. In the math, he was taught Vedas, tradition and history, which eventually instilled a sense of spirituality in him.[38] In addition to spiritual lessons, he also began acting in plays at the math. His aspiration towards theatre grew at the math and was once given an opportunity to enact the role of Ekalavya's friend from the Hindu epic Mahabharata. His performance in the play received praise from the Kannada poet D. R. Bendre.</p>

        <h3>About Ajith: </h3>
        <p>Ajith Kumar Subramaniam[2] (born 1 May 1971) is an Indian actor who works predominantly in Tamil cinema. To date, he has starred in over 63 films, and won four Vijay Awards, three Cinema Express Awards, three Filmfare Awards South and three Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. In addition to his acting career, Ajith is also an occasional racing driver and participated in the MRF Racing series (2010) and having competed in circuits around India in places such as Mumbai, Chennai and Delhi. He is one among very few Indians to race in the international arena and in Formula championships. Based on the annual earnings of Indian celebrities, he was included in the Forbes India Celebrity 100 list three times.[3] Ajith began his career with a small role in the 1990 Tamil romantic drama En Veedu En Kanavar. After his success in Rajavin Parvaiyile, his first major breakthrough was Aasai (1995), Ajith established himself as a romantic hero with Kadhal Kottai (1996), Kaadhal Mannan (1998) and Aval Varuvala (1998), and established himself as an action hero starting with the film Amarkalam (1999). Ajith's dual portrayal of twin brothers—where one is deaf-mute—in S. J. Suryah's Vaalee (1999) won him his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil. He earned critical acclaim for his dual roles in the vigilante film Citizen (2001).</p>
        <p>He was also praised for his dual role performance in K. S. Ravikumar’s Villain (2002) where he won his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor - Tamil. In 2006, he starred in K. S. Ravikumar's Varalaru, in which he played three roles including one of a idical Bharatanatyam dancer. It became the highest-grossing Tamil film of 2006, and earned him another Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil.[5] The following year he starred in two remakes—Kireedam (2007) and Billa (2007),[a] both of which earned him critical acclaim.[5] Ajith played an antagonist in his 50th film Mankatha (2011),[6] which became one of the highest-grossing Tamil films of all time.[7] His next release, Billa II (2012), was Tamil cinema's first prequel.[b] Ajith has also been abroad for various races, including Germany and Malaysia. He drove in the 2003 Formula Asia BMW Championships.[9] He raced in the 2010 Formula 2 Championship along with two Indians, Armaan Ebrahim and Parthiva Sureshwaren.[10] In 2025, Government of India honoured him with Padma Bhushan, the nation's third highest civilian honour</p>
        <p>Ajith dropped out of Asan Memorial Senior Secondary School during his tenth grade, before he had completed his higher secondary schooling.[22] Through a family friend who worked with the Enfield company, Ajith was able to get a job as an apprentice and spent six months training to be a mechanic.[23] He later quit the role at the insistence of his father, who wanted Ajith to have a white-collar job, and joined another family friend's garment exporting company as an apprentice. He eventually progressed to become a business developer and regularly travelled throughout the country on sales assignments, improving his English-speaking skills.[23] After resigning from the role, Ajith set up a textiles business distributing fabric alongside three other partners. The business venture underperformed prompting Ajith to take up another job in the garments industry.[23] During the period, Ajith also began working on modelling assignments alongside his work. He was notably scouted by P. C. Sreeram during the making of a commercial for Hercules Cycle and Motor Company, who felt he had the appearance to become an actor</p>

The film explores themes of corporate fraud, banking scams, and social justice, with high-voltage action sequences and mind games. It marked a major collaboration between Ajith, director H. Vinoth, and producer Boney Kapoor for the third time. The music, composed by Ghibran, includes the viral hit song “Chilla Chilla”. Released on 11 January 2023, ahead of Pongal, Thunivu clashed with Varisu at the box office but emerged as a commercial success.

            <p>Parthasarathy Srinivasan (born 7 November 1954),[4] known professionally as Kamal Haasan, is an Indian actor, filmmaker and politician who predominantly works in Tamil cinema. Considered as one of the most accomplished actors of Indian Cinema, Haasan is also known for introducing many new technologies to Tamil cinema.[5][6][7] Besides Tamil films, he has also appeared in some Malayalam, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada and Bengali films. He has won numerous accolades, including four National Film Awards, nine Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, four Nandi Awards, one Rashtrapati Award, two Filmfare Awards and eighteen Filmfare Awards South.

After a sabbatical, he received his breakthrough with the 1975 drama Apoorva Raagangal, directed by K. Balachander, in which he played a rebellious youth who falls in love with an older woman which earned him his first Filmfare Award.

                <p>Nayakan (1987) is a legendary Tamil crime drama film directed by Mani Ratnam, starring Kamal Haasan in one of his most iconic roles as Velu Naicker, a character inspired by the real-life Mumbai don Varadarajan Mudaliar. The story traces the transformation of a common man into a powerful underworld figure in Bombay's Dharavi slums, fighting for the oppressed Tamil people. It explores themes of justice, morality, love, and loss, as Velu rises from a traumatized orphan to a feared gangster, but ultimately faces the consequences of his violent path. Kamal Haasan’s intense performance, especially in emotional scenes, earned him the National Film Award for Best Actor. The film’s gripping screenplay, powerful dialogues, and emotional depth made it a milestone in Indian cinema. The haunting music and background score by Ilaiyaraaja elevated the film’s atmosphere. Released in 1987, Nayakan was a critical and commercial success and was later selected by TIME magazine as one of the "All-Time 100 Best Films". It remains a timeless classic and a benchmark in Indian filmmaking.</p>

                    Dasavathaaram is a 2008 Tamil-language science fiction action thriller film directed by K. S. Ravikumar and written by and starring Kamal Haasan in ten different roles. The film spans multiple timelines, starting from the 12th century Chidambaram to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, blending history, science, and chaos theory. Kamal plays a range of diverse characters including a scientist, a 12th-century Vaishnavite, an American CIA agent, a Japanese martial artist, a Punjabi pop singer, and more — showcasing his incredible versatility. The plot centers around Govind, a scientist trying to protect a vial containing a deadly biological weapon, which accidentally travels across the country. The chase involves multiple characters with conflicting interests, all converging in a dramatic climax. The film touches on themes like religion, fate, science, and humanity, with the idea that even the smallest action can trigger massive consequences — inspired by the butterfly effect.

            <h3>About Surya: </h3>
            <p>Saravanan Sivakumar (born 23 July 1975[2][3]), known professionally as Suriya, is an Indian actor and film producer who primarily works in Tamil films. One of the highest-paid Tamil actors,[4][5] Suriya is considered as one of the finest actors of Indian cinema.[6][7] Suriya has received numerous accolades including two National Film Awards, six Filmfare Awards South and five Tamil Nadu State Film Awards.[8][9] He has featured six times in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list. After making his debut in Nerukku Ner (1997) at the age of 22, Suriya landed his breakthrough role in Nandhaa (2001) and then had his first major commercial success with the thriller Kaakha Kaakha (2003). Following award-winning performances of a conman in Pithamagan (2003) and a hunchback in Perazhagan (2004), he played a man suffering from anterograde amnesia in the 2005 blockbuster Ghajini.</p>
            <p>Prior to his career in films, Suriya worked at a garment exports factory for eight months.[19] He did not reveal himself to his boss as Sivakumar's son, but his boss ultimately learnt the truth himself.[20] He was initially offered the lead role by Vasanth in his film Aasai (1995), but he rejected the offer citing a lack of interest in an acting career and the offer went to Ajith Kumar.[18] He later debuted in Vasanth's 1997 film Nerrukku Ner, produced by Mani Ratnam when he was 22 years of age.[21] The stage name "Suriya" was bestowed to him by Ratnam to avoid a clash of names with established actor Saravanan. The name "Suriya" was frequently used for characters in Ratnam's films.[22] Vijay, who co-starred with him in the film, would also go on to become a leading contemporary actor in Kollywood.</p>
            <p>This was followed by a series of roles in commercially unsuccessful films in the late 1990s. In 1998, he starred in the romantic film Kaadhale Nimmadhi.[24] In July the same year, he had another release Sandhippoma.[25] Subsequently, he acted with Vijayakanth in the film Periyanna (1999), directed by S. A. Chandrasekhar.[26] That year, he also appeared opposite Jyothika in Poovellam Kettuppar. A critic from The New Indian Express noted, "The-romantic part has little novelty, but Jyothika and Surya perform with bouncy exuberance."[27] His only release in 2000 was Uyirile Kalanthathu, again opposite Jyothika.[28] Suriya confessed that he struggled due to lack of confidence, memory power, fighting or dancing skills in his early career, but it was actor Raghuvaran, one of his mentors, who advised him to create his own identity, rather than stay under his father's shadow.</p>

                <p>Anjaan is a 2014 Tamil-language action thriller film directed by N. Lingusamy, starring Suriya in dual roles alongside Samantha Ruth Prabhu, with music composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja. The film follows the story of Raju Bhai, a feared gangster in Mumbai, and his close friend Chandru, as seen through the eyes of Raju’s disabled brother Krishna, who sets out to find him after he goes missing. As Krishna investigates, he uncovers the dark and violent underworld life led by his brother and the betrayal that led to his disappearance. Set against a stylish Mumbai backdrop, the movie tries to blend mass action, emotional drama, and gangster themes. Suriya’s performance, especially his look and charisma as Raju Bhai, was a major highlight, and the songs like “Bang Bang Bang” and “Ek Do Teen” were popular among fans. Released on 15 August 2014, Anjaan had a massive opening due to high expectations, but received mixed to negative reviews for its predictable plot and lack of depth. Despite its flaws, it was noted for its slick visuals and mass appeal, making it a decent one-time watch for action lovers.</p>

                   24 is a 2016 Tamil science fiction thriller directed by Vikram Kumar, starring Suriya in triple roles as a brilliant scientist Sethuraman, his evil twin Athreya, and the scientist's son Mani. The story revolves around a time-travel watch invented by Sethuraman, which allows the user to pause, rewind, or fast-forward time. When Athreya kills his brother to steal the watch but ends up in a coma, the device eventually lands in the hands of Mani, who uncovers its secrets and his family’s past. Packed with clever twists, emotional depth, and high-stakes action, the film is elevated by A. R. Rahman’s music and Suriya’s powerful performances, especially as the menacing Athreya. Released on 6 May 2016, 24 was praised for its innovative storytelling and became a box office hit, marking one of Tamil cinema’s finest entries in the time-travel genre.
